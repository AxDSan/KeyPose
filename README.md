Still this is pretty early in development, it doesn't do literally anything for the main functionality of the program, apart the animations that are working, nevertheless, pretty is promissing, I'll continue further development on my free time.

Note: As you may notice this is just as Windows-Keystroker, but now It's on Managed Code (.NET)
